How are you today?
Are you sure?
You feel okay?
It's been a long long time
'Cause you've been stored
For nearly half your life

Like Jaybird when she flies
Something good
Will across the sky
I hope she lands her way
And opens some doors
So you can show your face

I know a breeze
When I feel it
I know the trees
When I see them
I know a kiss
When I taste it

How are you today?
Are you sure?
You're still okay?
It's been a long long time
But now you're reborn
Dragged out into light

I know a breeze
When I feel it
I know the trees
When I see them
I know a kiss
When I taste it
And I know my life
And I'll take it
